        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Krina Shah and I am currently studying Linguistics at the University of California, Riverside. I am currently a second year student and am enrolled in four classes this quarter. Being a Linguistics major, I have had to complete a lot of the general education requirements. I have taken a wide array of courses ranging from philosophy to entomology. I am studying linguistics because I hope to one day become a speech language pathologist. To become a speech language pathologist, I would need to further my education after completing my undergraduate degree and obtain a masters as well as a certification. I am passionate about my career choice because I wanted to pick a profession that allows me to work one on one with people and make a direct impact on their lives. I specifically want to be a pediatric speech language pathologist because I have worked with children for a long time and love doing so. I am excited for what my future holds, and looking forward to seizing any opportunity that comes my way.
<br><br>

        During my time here at the University of California, Riverside so far, I have made it a priority to become as involved on campus as possible. Within last year and this current year, I have been involved in three major clubs that have become very important to my social and personal life, giving me connections as well as a multitude of life skills. The first, and highest position I have, is being the events director for the South Asian Federation. Last year, I found my place on the board as an intern, and through the different skills I learned about leadership and time management, I was able to successfully transition into the role I hold now. As an events director, I am in charge of throwing weekly or bi-weekly events for the entirety of the South Asian student community here at UCR. These events take a great deal of planning on a tight schedule, and through excellent time management, communication with other members as well as vendors, and leadership to facilitate events in order to ensure success for the club and for me.  
<br><br>

      While maintaining a busy academic and extracurricular schedule, it is important to me to ensure that I have time to pursue my passions. One of my passions that I have had since I was a child has been dance. At UCR, I am a member of the Riverside Bhangra Team. Bhangra is a Punjabi folk dance that is full of high energy and complex moves. I had only started this style of dance my freshman year, and I was determined to excel. I put in the work and secured my position on the competitive team, being the youngest member to join. Our team continued on and got accepted into a national competition taking place in Texas, and I put in the hours to make the routine a success and have a successful competition while also maintaining my academic schedule.
